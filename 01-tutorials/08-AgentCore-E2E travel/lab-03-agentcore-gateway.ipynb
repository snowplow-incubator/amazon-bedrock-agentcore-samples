    "# Lab 3: Securely connect tools to your Agent with AgentCore Gateway \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, you will learn how to integrate tools available in your organization with the Travel Agent using the Amazon Bedrock Gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide tools and context to Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "With [Amazon Bedrock Agent Core Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html), developers can convert APIs, Lambda functions, and existing services into MCP-compatible tools and make them available to agents through Gateway endpoints with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done):** Create Agent Prototype - Built a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Done):** Enhance with Memory - Added conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3 (Current):** Scale with Gateway & Identity - Shared tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4:** Deploy to Production - Used AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5:** Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AgentCore Gateway & Tool Sharing Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Current State (Lab 1-2): Each agent has its own copy of tools. A practice that is not scalable and leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code duplication across different agents\n",
    "- Inconsistent tool behavior and maintenance overhead\n",
    "- No centralized security or access control\n",
    "- Difficulty scaling to multiple use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lab, we will have centralized, reusable tools that can serve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Support Agent (our current use case)\n",
    "- Sales Agent (needs same product info and customer data)\n",
    "- Inventory Agent (needs same product info and warranty checking)\n",
    "- Returns Processing Agent (needs return policies and customer profiles)\n",
    "\n",
    "and other use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding secure authentication with AgentCore Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, AgentCore Gateway requires you to securely authenticate both inbound and outbound connections. [AgentCore Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.html) provides seamless agent identity and access management across AWS services and third-party applications such as Slack and Zoom while supporting any standard identity providers such as Okta, Entra, and Amazon Cognito. In this lab we will see how AgentCore Gateway integrates with AgentCore Identity to provide secure connections via inbound and outbound authentication. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the inbound authentication, the AgentCore Gateway analyzes the OAuth token passed during invocation to decide allow or deny the access to a tool in the gateway. If a tool needs access to external resources, the AgentCore Gateway can use outbound authentication via API Key, IAM or OAuth Token to allow or deny the access to the external resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the inbound authorization flow, an agent or the MCP client calls an MCP tool in the AgentCore Gateway adding an OAuth access token (generated from the user’s IdP). AgentCore Gateway then validates the OAuth access token and performs inbound authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tool running in AgentCore Gateway needs to access external resources, OAuth will retrieve credentials of downstream resources using the resource credential provider for the Gateway target. AgentCore Gateway pass the authorization credentials to the caller to get access to the downstream API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture for Lab 3\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:left\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/architecture_lab3_gateway.png\" width=\"75%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Web search tool is now centralized in AgentCore Gateway with secure identity-based access control. Multiple agents and use cases can share the same tool securely. We will also reuse the `check_warranty()` tool built for other applications and add the `web_search()` tool for use within other applications. `get_product_info()`, `get_return_policy()`, and `get_technical_support` remain as local tools as they are specific to the customer support use case*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Seamlessly integrate AWS Lambda functions:** This example shows how to integrate your Agent with existing AWS Lambda functions to check the warranty of an item and to get the customer profile using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway.\n",
    "- **Secure your Gateway endpoint with Inbound Auth**: Only an Agent providing a valid JWT token can connect to the endpoint to use the tools\n",
    "- **Configure the Agent to use the MCP endpoint**: The Agent gets a valid JWT token and uses it to connect to the MCP endpoint provided by AgentCore Gateway\n",
    "\n",

    "You have successfully completed Lab 3: Securely connect tools to your Agent with AgentCore Gateway\n",
    "\n",
    "What You Accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tool Centralization & Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Migrated web search from local tool to centralized AgentCore Gateway\n",
    "- Integrated existing enterprise Lambda functions (TODO)\n",
    "- Created a shared tool infrastructure that multiple agent types can access\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Enterprise-Grade Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented JWT-based authentication with Cognito integration\n",
    "- Configured secure inbound authorization for gateway access\n",
    "- Established identity-based access control for tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scalable Architecture Foundation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built reusable tools that serve multiple use cases (fetching behavioral attributes)\n",
    "- Eliminated code duplication across different agents\n",
    "- Created centralized management for tool updates and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Current Limitations (We'll fix these next!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Development Environment** - Still running on your laptop, not production-ready\n",
    "- **Limited Observability** - No comprehensive monitoring of agent behavior and performance\n",
    "- **Manual Scaling** - Cannot automatically handle increased load or multiple concurrent users\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Next Up: Lab 4 - Deploying to Production with AgentCore Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 4, you'll transform your prototype into a production-ready system with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AgentCore Runtime for scalable agent deployment\n",
    "- Comprehensive observability with metrics, logging, and tracing\n",
    "- Auto-scaling capabilities to handle real-world traffic\n",
